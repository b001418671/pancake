                    <h2>Our Vending Machine Features</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Our Innovative Vending Machine Technology</strong></li>
                           <p>At Pancake-inator, we pride ourselves on offering an innovative and efficient food experience. Our cutting-edge vending machines are designed to deliver <strong>fresh, made-to-order pancakes </strong>in just <strong>2-3 minutes‚Äî</strong>a quick, satisfying meal for busy individuals on the go.</p> 
                            
                           <li><strong> Fast and Efficient Cooking</strong></li>
                           <p>Our machines are built for speed and efficiency, ensuring that each pancake is freshly cooked to perfection in just a matter of minutes, allowing you to enjoy a hot, delicious meal without the wait.</p>
                            
                           <li><strong> Self-Cleaning Technology</strong></li>
                           <p>To ensure optimal hygiene and maintain the highest standards of cleanliness, our machines are equipped with advanced self-cleaning technology. After each cooking cycle, the machine undergoes a thorough cleaning process using a <strong> non-toxic cleaning solution</strong>. This solution is carefully applied with built-in wipers, followed by a thorough rinse with water to remove any batter residue.</p>
                            
                           <li><strong> Hygienic Water Disposal</strong></li>
                           <p>The used cleaning water is collected in a separate tank and flushed out, ensuring that no dirty water remains in the system. This process guarantees a clean and sanitary environment for each new customer.</p>
                            
                            <li><strong>Drying and Sterilization</strong></li>
                            <p>To further maintain hygiene, our machines use a <strong>hot air blowing device</strong> to dry all surfaces after cleaning. Additionally, we employ  <strong>UV-C lights</strong> in key areas‚Äîsuch as the batter dispensing nozzle and storage tanks‚Äîare used to sterilize surfaces and eliminate bacteria, ensuring a safe and clean experience with every pancake made. The <strong> UV-C light is carefully shielded </strong> within the machine to prevent direct exposure to the public. While the light is active, <strong> indicators</strong> will show that the sterilization process is taking place, so you can feel confident knowing that the machine is being cleaned effectively without any risk to your eyes or skin.</p>
                            
                            <li><strong>On-Demand Pancake Batter</strong></li>
                            <p>In case you‚Äôre wondering how your pancakes will be stored: our machines use a <strong> dry mix solution </strong> containing powdered milk and other ingredients. This ensures the batter remains fresh and ready for use. <strong> Water is added on demand </strong> right before cooking, ensuring that each pancake is made from a freshly mixed, high-quality batter, every time.</p>
                            
                            <li><strong>Transparency and Trust</strong></li>
                            <p>We understand that hygiene is a top priority for our customers. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve made our cleaning process <strong> observable to the public</strong>, allowing you to witness the care we take in ensuring that our machines are always clean and ready for use. This transparency helps build trust and addresses any concerns you may have regarding the safety and cleanliness of our vending machines.</p>
